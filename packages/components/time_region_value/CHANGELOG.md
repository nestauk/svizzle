- adopted `eslint-plugin-svelte`, linted
- `Link` -> `HyperLink`

## `@svizzle/time_region_value` v0.9.6

## `@svizzle/time_region_value` v0.9.2

- updated deps

## `@svizzle/time_region_value` v0.9.1

- updated deps

## `@svizzle/time_region_value` v0.9.0

- changed the shape of `regionSettings`:
	- added:
		- `atlasBase`
		- `maxBbox`
		- `processing: {clipIds: [...], excludeIds: [...]}`
	- removed: `ignoredRegions`
- processes features:
	- clips features according to `processing.clipIds` and `maxBbox`
	- filters out features according to `processing.excludeIds`
- keyboard support:
	- various inner components, [b], [e], [k]
	- `GeoFilterModal`: handle `keydown` event from the route
	- `XorSelector`: add `keydown` event
- updated props used in `BarchartVDiv`
- use `XorSelector` from `/ui`
- updated license year

[b] better keyboard support
[e] use `event.key` instead of `event.keyCode` (now deprecated [1]) which is also more readable as we don't rely on numeric codes
[k] use `keydown` event instead of `keypress` (now deprecated [2])

## `@svizzle/time_region_value` v0.8.1

- upgraded `svelte`
- added `"svelte": "src/index.js"` field to `package.json`

## `@svizzle/time_region_value` v0.8.0

- upgrade to ESM:
	- moved `src/node_modules` to `src/lib`
	- `FetchManager` instance now loads exported objects instead of JSON files
	- moved `data/types.yml` to `data/types.js`
	- `package.json`:
		- fields:
			- added `"type": "module"`
			- added `main`
			- set `engines.node` to `>=17.5.0`
		- deps:
			- upgraded `d3-array`, `d3-dsv`, `d3-format`, `d3-geo`, `d3-quadtree`, `d3-scale`, `d3-scale-chromatic`, `d3-shape`, `eslint`, `eslint-plugin-svelte3`, `topojson-simplify`, `yootils`
			- removed `esm`, `eslint-plugin-import`
	- imports:
		- using file extensions
		- use the `node:` protocol
		- using relative paths in imports from `src/lib` to make sure this will be
			compatible with Kit
	- linting:
		- works now because of `src/lib` not being ignored:
		- removed some unused imports
		- renamed some vars to avoid shadowing in:
			- `src/lib/stores/selectedRegions.js`
			- `src/lib/stores/indicator.js`
			- these might cause feat changes / bugs
- now internally importing directly from svizzle modules index
- exposed some stores methods

## `@svizzle/time_region_value` v0.7.0

- use `FetchDriver.svelte` so that boundaries are pre-fetched in the background

 header to read them in full
- removed build scripts
- removed prerelease packaging scripts

## `@svizzle/time_region_value` v0.6.1

## `@svizzle/time_region_value` v0.6.0

- Fix the color scale and hide the legend when we have only 1 data point
- Show country codes in the bar chart
- Enhanced UX for `GeoFilterModal`
- Refactor:
	- Move stores in appropriate modules
		- rename `stores/barchart.js` -> `stores/indicatorYear.js`
		- move many stores from `stores/theme.js` to `stores/colors.js`
		- move some stores from `stores/indicator.js` to `stores/indicatorCurrent.js`
		- move some stores from `stores/indicator.js` to `stores/legend.js`
	- Use precomputed `rootIds` in `stores/selectedRegions.js`

## `@svizzle/time_region_value` v0.5.0

Breaking:
	- now supports NUTS levels 0123 for the whole of Europe
	- does not support NUTS2/UK specifically anymore
	- the schema required for this to work has changed (needs documentation)

Some implementation notes:
	- stores:
		- heavily refactored and changed their location within `src/node_modules/stores/`
		- use a function to `set` `_selectedYear` to make sure we set numbers
	- routes:
		- simplified as a lot of reactivity now happens in `derived`s
	- components:
		- a lot of these have been refactored to accomodate the new stores
		- `GeoFilterModal.svelte`: refactored + now uses `RegionsSelector`
		- `InfoModal.svelte`, `InfoView.svelte`: refactored + now show `region_types`
	- boundaries:
		- The current version does a lot of reconciliation between the pair `[NUTS_ID, region_year_spec]` and the `atlasId` for a region, resulting in the code being a bit convolute and with suboptimal performance.
		- Some of the current reconciliation code could be avoided by using the `atlasId` property provided to topojsons features by `/atlas` but we need to release this version to test it in an app, hence we'll need to add that optimisation in a future version.
